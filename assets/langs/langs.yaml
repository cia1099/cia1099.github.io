      Developing AI combined with vision applications: smart home, people counting; expert in spatial localization by vision, enabling the camera to perceive its surroundings, allowing us to spatialize digital modeling and 3D space recognition; working on edge computing, with the goal of executing AI models on edge devices to significantly reduce the cost of landing projects. Furthermore I'd like to develope more AI application scenarios to implement AI on devices in public, and to integrate AI into our lives.

      Live stream application development. We published the app for crossed platform mobile devices by flutter. I am responsible of any animation, game and native plugin request in app. We have used Agora to get realtime media stream communication, SQLite to save and load as soon as local retrieval, build GraphQL client to fetch customized data resource, used Firebase for Notification, etc. I have also developed Swift and Objective-C++ experiences in hybrid compiles between Swift and Cpp programming. In addition, I have supported Cpp libraries to cross platform plugin for flutter.

      We develop computer vision algorithms for Internet of Things applications, and develop intelligent houses that allow residents to control furniture with eye-tracking models. Using 3D camera scanning and Open3D building method to build a point cloud map of the house environment, with Mask-RCNN detecting RGB image objects, combining the anchor of RGB detection and depth to map to the point cloud which is an alternative to object detection under 3D space. Use LineTR algorithm to locate the camera in the point cloud map, LineTR algorithm extracts features of key points in query image, compared query and scanning image of record in feature space, we can get the best matching result for camera pose in image pair. Write flutter to develop mobile user interface for setting WIFI to remotely select the target objects of furniture that the system wants to user watching. Write the project patent.
